We use four different and geographically diverse real world Twitter
data sets for our experiments. Table 2. shows the information on
our datasets.
(I). Freeport Dataset (FP): The Freeport dataset contains tweets
published from Jan 2017-April 2017 on the coal protests in Indonesia. During this period, there were series of protest actions towards
Indonesian mining giants with protesters calling for the mines to
be shut down.
(II). US-Ghana Military Base (USGM): The dataset captures series of population level events that sparked nationwide protest
against the establishment of a US Military base in Ghana. The data
covers tweets published from March 19 - March 30 2018.
(II). US Moving Embassy to Jerusalem (USJM): This dataset
covers from Jun 2018- July 2018, on the announcement of the movement of the US embassy from Tel-Aviv to Jerusalem. This decision
sparked global outrage leading to a series of violent events in the
Middle-east and other parts of the world.
(II). Live Exports in Australia: This dataset covers a one month
period of series of organized protest and aftermath events to stop
the exportation of live animals in Australia. This datasets spans
from June 3rd- June 30th 2018.

With the exception of the FP-Datasets that was provided by
the D2DCRC, all other datasets used in the work as well as the
user follower network was crawled through the Twitter API by
the authors. We implemented and conducted all experiments using
Python 3.2 and 3.6 on a Windows machine with 8GB Memory and
a 64-bit Linux virtual machine with 6GB memory all running on
an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4310m CPU 2.70Ghz processor.
